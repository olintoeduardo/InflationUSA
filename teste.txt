Question 1
The csv files were downloaded from the following links:
https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0
https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0L1E
https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUSR0000SETB01 
Then they were renamed to:
allitems.csv
allitems_foodenergy.csv
gasoline.csv

The file in which all data was stores accordingly is named InflationUSA.csv
The non-existent values in all times/less food & energy and gasoline is due to the lack of their availability until a certain year (1957 and 1967 respectively).

Question 3
Attention to downloads path files, since a Mac OS was used and not a Windows OS.

Question 5
When running the code use the following terminal command (Linux or Mac OS):
uvicorn question_5:app --reload

Then click on the link http://127.0.0.1:8000 to access the root page, and http://127.0.0.1:8000/data/{data} , data being either gasoline, allItems or allItems-lessfood&energy to view each of CPI indexes data.
