Explain how you would relate the price series All items with the Gasoline price series.

First by importing both csv files from the all items series and the gasoline series into pandas time series dataframes using the Label as the date frame. 

Than, change the monthly frequency to annual and thus calculate the % annual variation for both series. 

The next step would be to merge them into one single dataframe, and graph time in the x axis and both the gasoline and all items % annual variations in the y axis as two separate lines.

By analysing the graph we can see similar patterns on both curves. By imagining the derivatives of the graphs (the variation of both indexes over time), we can see that we have similar turning points in time, as for example, clearly evident maximum points in December 1974, December 1979, December 1990, December 2009 and December 2021. The same goes for the minimum points. However, it is important to notice how expressive are the increases in the All Items CPI index compared to the Gasoline one over time, indicating higher volatility.
